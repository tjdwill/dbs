# Icon Sources

For icons, I'm strongly considering Icons8. They are free, and their attribution requirement
consists of: 
- Linking to the main website (icons8.com)
- Linking to every icon used. 
  - I thought this meant I needed to include a link exactly *where* the icon is used, but [this
    link](https://community.icons8.com/t/free-license-attribution-requirements/1708) proves that it
    is sufficient to simply link to a source that contains all of the icons used and their links.
    Note that the user, elena_icons8, is the same person who wrote [this
    article](https://intercom.help/icons8-7fb7577e8170/en/articles/5534926-universal-multimedia-license-agreement-for-icons8)
    about the website's licensing.
